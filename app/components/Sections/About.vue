                Programmer, designer, sportsman and just a positive person, who get a lot of experience in his life! This is one of the examples of my designer work. I am constantly developing and learning something new, just in one year I found a job in IT from scratch and gained many qualifications in both frontend and backend sphere. Creating sites is very interesting and entertaining for me. Maybe I am not a master in this business, but someday it will definitely become. My strong point is willpower, which helps me to achieve everything I want.!
